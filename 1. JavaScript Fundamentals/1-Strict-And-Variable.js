"use strict";

num = 5;
console.log(5); 

// it shows 5 while not using strict.
// And we use Strict it shows "num us not defined"


// The directive looks like a string: "use strict" or 'use strict'. When it is located at the top of a script, the whole script works the “modern” way.

/*

We can declare variables to store data by using the var, let, or const keywords.

let – is a modern variable declaration.
var – is an old-school variable declaration. Normally we don’t use it at all, but we’ll cover subtle differences from let in the chapter The old "var", just in case you need them.
const – is like let, but the value of the variable can’t be changed.
Variables should be named in a way that allows us to easily understand what’s inside them.
